		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping.
			Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can
			take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end
			result.
		</p>
		<p>
			After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on
			one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on
			the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the
			two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as
			basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick
			stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a
			stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer.
